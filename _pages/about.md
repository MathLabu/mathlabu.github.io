Hi! I am **{{ site.name }}** &#128075;,

I am currently working as a Research Engineer in Computer Vision at Institut Pascal.
I'll start working in September as an Associate Professor at Université Clermont Auvergne, France:
* **Teaching activities** at [IUT Clermont Auvergne](https://iut.uca.fr/), in the Industrial Engineering and Maintenance department (GIM), 
* **Research activities** at [Institut Pascal](http://www.institutpascal.uca.fr/index.php/en/), in the Computer Vision research team of the Image, Systems of Perception and Robotics ([ISPR](https://ispr-ip.fr/)) department.

# Research Activities

My research topics are organized along two main axes:

1.  **Computer Vision**, with a focus on plenoptic imaging and
    *light-field* technologies, sensors calibration (conventional and 
    non-conventional), and depth estimation;
2.  **Robotics**, with a focus on 3D mapping, localization, and the use of 
    lidar sensors (point clouds, 3D registration, and in particular Iterative 
    Closest Point (ICP) algorithms).
